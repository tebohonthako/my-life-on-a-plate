      steps: [
        // Step 1: Prepare the Meat Sauce
        "In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté until they become translucent.",
        "Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute, being careful not to let it burn.",
        "Add the ground beef to the saucepan and cook until it's browned and fully cooked.",
        "Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, water, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.",
        "Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce the heat and let it cook for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
  
        // Step 2: Prepare the Ricotta Filling
        "In a separate bowl, mix the ricotta cheese, egg, and grated Parmesan cheese until well combined. Set aside.",
  
        // Step 3: Cook the Lasagne Sheets
        "Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).",
        "In a large pot, bring water to a boil and cook the lasagne sheets according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.",
  
        // Step 4: Assemble the Lasagne
        "In a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce at the bottom.",
        "Place 3 lasagne sheets over the sauce to cover the bottom of the dish.",
        "Spread half of the ricotta filling evenly over the lasagne sheets.",
        "Sprinkle about 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese over the ricotta filling.",
        "Add another layer of meat sauce on top of the cheese.",
        "Repeat the layers: lasagne sheets, ricotta filling, mozzarella cheese, and meat sauce.",
        "For the final layer, place the remaining 3 lasagne sheets and cover them with the remaining meat sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese.",
  
        // Step 5: Bake the Lasagne
        "Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, making sure it's tented so it doesn't touch the cheese.",
        "Bake the lasagne in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.",
        "Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes or until the cheese on top is melted and golden.",
  
        // Step 6: Let It Rest and Serve
        "Once the lasagne is done baking, remove it from the oven and let it rest for about 10 minutes before cutting.",
        "Serve hot and enjoy your delicious Classic Beef Lasagne!"
